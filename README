WHAT:
-------------------------------------------
Implementations of fast exact k-means algorithms as described in ?, available through
the following interfaces:

(1) Shared library with accompanying C++ header file
(2) Command-line executable
(3) Python library


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------------------------------------
Minimal installation requirements:
-- C++ compiler supporting C++11
-- Linux operating system

Optional but recommended:
-- BLAS, we recommend the implementation at http://www.openblas.net/

Specific for Python library:
-- any version of Python  



CONFIGURATION:
-------------------------------------------
In Makefile, set
WITHBLAS, LIBDIR
as per directions in Makefile

if WITHBLAS set to YES, then set 
LIBBLASDIR, INCBLASDIR
unless necessary blas paths will be found automatically

if you wish to install the python library, then set
PYLIBDIR
as per direction in Makefile

Remember! Paths LIBDIR and PYLIBDIR need to be added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH
resectively, before building


BUILDING:
-------------------------------------------
For (1) and (2) : Run `make all' in terminal
For (1) and (2) and (3) : Run `make all pythonkmeans' in terminal


USING: 
-------------------------------------------
(2) If successfully installed, you should find an executable in directory
./bins/kmeans/bin (either withblaskmeans or blaslesskmeans depending on WITHBLAS)
Run the executable with -h flag to see the options

(3) If successfully installed, you should be able to `import kmeans'. Example use is
found in cython/kmeans/examples
