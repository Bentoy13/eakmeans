header files for several low-level and not-so-level operations. low-level operations which benefit from blas/SSE are implemented in separate header files of the same name, which one to use should be indicated via the -I flag to the compiler. More specifically, if the blas version is used: the compiler should receive 
-I/path/to/arrutilv2/withblasbase/include -I/path/to/directory/containig/cblas.h 
and the linker should receive 
-L/path/to/blas/lib/
If the non-blas version is used, simply include the
-I/path/to/arrutilv2/blaslessbase/include
as a compile flag.
